## :test_tube: Abstract

In this project, we explore the development of data engineering and ML pipelines, with a specific emphasis on constructing an Entity Resolution (ER) pipeline for deduplicating research publication datasets.

The initial phase involves acquiring the datasets and transforming them from TXT to CSV format. Subsequently, we proceed to create a local entity resolution pipeline designed to merge related entities.

In the final stage, we were hands-on PySpark framework to reimplement our local pipline on top of a data-parallel computation framework. We also evaluate the scalability of the module through comprehensive testing.

## Data Acquisition and Preparation (Part 1)

In this section, we acquire datasets related to research publications. These
datasets, available in text format, can be reached by
[clicking here](https://www.aminer.org/citation).

As a prerequisite for Entity Resolution and Model Training, we have
generated a dataset containing the following attributes:

> - Paper ID, paper title, author names, publication venue, year of publication
>
> - Publications published between 1995 and 2004
>
> - Publications from VLDB and SIGMOD venues

We utilized Pandas DataFrame, to convert the datasets from TXT to CSV. Our code
iterates through the text file, extracting entries separated by double newlines
and filtering based on the specified criteria. The resulting cleaned dataframes
are exported to the local `data` folder.

> The code for this section can be found in the file named `preparing.py` under
> the function called `prepare_data`. Additionally, the resulting CSV files are
> available in the local `data` folder with the suffix `__1995_2004.csv`.

## Entity Resolution Pipeline (Part 2)

We aim to apply an entity resolution pipeline to the aforementioned datasets,
following the scheme depicted below:

### Prepare Data

Continuing from the previous section, we employ various data cleaning techniques.
It converts all characters to lowercase, ensures uniformity, and eliminates
special characters, retaining only alphanumeric characters, spaces, and commas.
This process standardizes and cleans the textual data for easier comparison
and analysis.

> The code for this part is available in the file named `preparing.py` under
> the function called `prepare_data`.

### Blocking

Blocking is employed to reduce the number of comparisons by using effective
partitioning strategies. In each 'bucket', we run the comparisons
(see section below). Our blocking is achieved through partitioning based on attributes:

1. **Year :** Articles that were published in the same year would be in the same bucket.
2. **Two Year :** Articles that were published in the same year or in the adjacent year would be in the same bucket.
3. **Num Authors :** Articles with a similar number of authors (up to 1 difference) would be in the same bucket.
4. **Common Author :** Articles with at leat one common authors would be in the same bucket.
5. **Num Authors and Common Author :** Articles with at leat one common authors and a similar number of authors (up to 2 difference) would be in the same bucket.
6. **First Letter :** Articles with the same first letter of title would be in the same bucket.
7. **First or Last Letter :** Articles with the same first letter or the last letter of title would be in the same bucket.
8. **Last Name :** Articles with at least an author with the common last name would be in the same bucket.

> The code for blocking is in the file named `matching.py`, with functions
> named `blocking_x`, where x is the respective blocking method.

### Matching

Before discussing comparison methods, some terms related to our pipeline are
introduced:

- Baseline - We establish a baseline by comparing every pair between datasets, given a certain
  similarity function applied. This is our 'ground truth'.
- Prediction - Our model prediction is generated by comparing each pair within a bucket, given the
  same similarity function applied to the respective baseline.

**Jaccard -** The Jaccard similarity function is employed to measure the
extent to which two sets share common elements. It does so by calculating
the ratio of the shared elements to the total elements in both sets.
Thresholds of 0.5 and 0.7 are used in the comparison of the 'paper title'
attribute.

**Combined -** This function calculates a combined similarity score
between two papers based on their titles and author names. It utilizes
Jaccard similarity for title comparison and, if available, trigram
similarity for author name comparison. The final combined similarity
score is a weighted sum of title and author name similarities, with
70% weight assigned to the title and 30% to the author names. If author
names are missing for either paper, the function defaults to using
only the Jaccard similarity of titles.

For the blocking methods mentioned above:

**Jaccard** similarity function with **Year** partitioning identifies matching
articles with similar titles published in the same year.

**Jaccard** and **Two-year** partitioning identifies matching articles
with similar titles published in the same year or in the adjacent year.

**Jaccard** and **Num Authors** partitioning identifies matching articles
with similar titles and a similar number of authors.

**Jaccard** and **First Letter** partitioning identifies matching articles
with similar titles and the same first letter of the paper title.

**Jaccard** and **Last Letter** partitioning identifies matching articles
with similar titles and the same last letter of the paper title.

**Jaccard** and **First or Last Letter** partitioning identifies matching articles
with similar titles and the same first or last letter of the paper title.

**Jaccard** and **Authors last name** partitioning identifies matching articles
with similar titles and the author last name.

**Jaccard** and **Common Authors** partitioning identifies matching articles
with similar titles and the same authors.

**Jaccard** and **Num of Authors** partitioning identifies matching articles
with similar titles and the difference between their numbers of authors are smaller than 1.

**Jaccard** and **Num of Authors and Common Author** partitioning identifies matching articles
with similar titles and at leat one common Author with the difference between their numbers of authors smaller than 1.

Likewise, the **Combined** similarity will yield results for the
different blocking methods, with only difference being that it takes
into account the number of authors in the comparison.

> The code for this part is available in the file named `matching.py`, with
> functions named `calculate_x`, where x is the respective similarity method.
> CSV files for each similarity function and blocking method will be exported
> to a local `results` folder.

Testing different combinations yields the results shown below:

[Matching Results csv File](./results/method_results.csv)
![Matching Results](./results/comparasion_img.png)

The best model is based on the combination of the **'First or Last Letter'** blocking and the **Combined** similarity function, for two main reasons:

1. The Combined similarity function has proven to yield more reliable results
   for matched entities upon close inspection of the data.
2. First or Last Letter Matching has seemed to outperform all the other methods in terms of Precision, Recall and F1 Score, and the execution time reduction is also enumerous.

### Clustering

In the final part of the pipeline, we chose to cluster the matched entities.

We use the Numpy package to create a graph, organizing related items into clusters of similar entities in our clustering process (clustering_basic). Each item is represented as a point in the graph. Connections between similar items, as identified in our matching output, are drawn in the graph. We then employ depth-first search (DFS) to traverse these connections, updating values as we explore and contributing to the organization of clusters in the final results.

> The code for clustering is available in the file named `clustering.py`,
> and the resulting CSV will be exported to a local `results` folder under
> the name `clustering_results_local.csv`.

## Data Parallel Entity Resolution Pipeline (Part 3)

At the beginning of this stage, we create an Entity Resolution pipeline using Apache Spark. We walk through all the phases of the Entity Resolution pipeline with the structured data frame. We employ a deployment model in our Pyspark environment utilizing a maximum number of local threads specified as local[*]. This deployment configuration enables parallel processing, leading to a substantial reduction in overall runtime. It also has a number of convenient built-in functions, for example, `df.filter` and `df.groupBy` help us with our blocking method.

In this Data Parallel framework, we mainly deploy one matching method (Combined Similarity), two matching methods (FirstLetterTitle and FirstLetter Matching) and one clustering method (basic clustering with graph).

> you can see the code for this part at ` dprep.py`

After using Spark's data frame, we wanted to compare it with our local pipeline (the one we constructed in part 2). The Two ER pipline is configured as :

```json
DEFAULT_ER_CONFIGURATION = {
    "threshold": 0.7,
    "matching_method": "Combined",
    "blocking_method": "FirstLetterTitle",
    "clustering_method": "basic",
    "output_filename": "clustering_results_local.csv",
}
```

The results are quite the same for all the method we implemented.

|                                      | FirstLetterTitle | FirstOrLastLetterTitle |
| ------------------------------------ | ---------------- | ---------------------- |
| Number of differences (dp and local) | 0                | 0                      |
| Number of matched pairs              | 1750             | 1778                   |

> you can see the code for this part under the functoin `naive_DPvsLocal` in `main.py`

Given that we have established the reliability of Spark’s pipeline, our objective is to evaluate the scalability performance of our pipelines. As a result, we have generated larger datasets with several modifications derived from our initial data.

To investigate the impact on our model, we introduced various alterations to the title, year, and author name. Specifically, for string inputs, we randomly selected n positions within the string and replaced a letter at each position with a randomly chosen alphabet. Moreover, for number inputs, we modified them by either incrementing or decrementing the value by n/2.
